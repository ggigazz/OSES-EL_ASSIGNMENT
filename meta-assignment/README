Please see the corresponding sections below for details and how to deploy it into your Yocto-based system.

I. Adding the meta-assignment layer to your build
=================================================
Move to your poky folder.

Run 'git clone https://github.com/ggigazz/OSES-EL_ASSIGNMENT' to clone this repository, after that move the two 'meta-*' folders into your poky root folder.

Make sure that you have successfully created the environment running 'source oe-init-build-env NAME_OF_YOUR_DISTRIBUTION', move into and then 
run 'bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-assignment' to add the layer to the PATH variable into the ./conf/layers.bb file.

In ./conf/local.conf append the following lines:
  IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " heartbeatmod"
  KERNEL_MODULE_AUTOLOAD += "heartbeatmod"
  IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " heartbeat"
and check also that the MACHINE variable is set to "raspberrypi3" or your version of RaspberryPi board.
  
From your distribution folder, launch 'bitbake core-full-image-cmdline' command to build the image.

After using lsblk to see the effective name of your MicroSD, burn it with the command 'sudo dd if=tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypiY/core-image-full-cmdline-raspberrypiY.rpi-sdimg of=/dev/sdZ bs=1M status=progress' where Y is your version of raspberry and Z is the letter of your disk.

Boot up the system, and move to /usr/bin folder and then launch the app using the command './heartbeat'.

II. Troubleshoot
========

If the app gives an error like "unable to open /dev/heartbeatmod: No such file or directory" check with the command 'cat /proc/devices | grep heartbeat' if the module is successfully loaded.
If it is not, please check if the file is in the image: go to the folder /lib/modules/NUMBER_OF_THE_DISTRIBUTION/kernel/drivers/misc and check if there is the heartbeatmod.ko file. Load it with the command 'insmod heartbeatmod.ko' and then relaunch the application.
